title: About
---
I scour the Internet and read meaningless things. I eat chips and salsa and I
think long and hard while watching TV. I'm boring, self-absorbed and witty. I'm a jerk-ass punk
who finds sarcasm to be the only way to happiness and you might not catch my
antic when I'm around conversing with you, but trust me, I'm being funny. I'm a
reclusive introvert with extroverted dreams and I hate social situations but
love to be around people. Just like you I'm bass-ackward in my ideologies and I mostly
don't give a fuck. I'm caringly apathetic and I'm optimistic about my growing
nihilism. The older I get the more I think I care-less, but we all know it's
bullshit.

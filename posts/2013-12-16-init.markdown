I suppose this is my first post. We are booting up here and it might be fun.

Here you will find some ramblings and thought. Mostly about nothing anyone cares
about.

[This site](https://github.com/kyleterry/kyte.io) is built in [Hakyll](https://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll).
Hakyll is a static site generator written in Haskell that is similar to Jekyll.
You can fork the source from Github if you wish.

Please stay tuned.
